# Screenshot Analysis Instructions

## CRITICAL VERIFICATION - Analysis logged & validated

Perform UNBIASED, CRITICAL analysis. Do NOT assume changes worked.

## Checklist (Answer each):

**1. Entity Count:** Scene reports {{entityCount}} entities. Count ACTUAL visible objects. Match?

**2. Positions:** For each entity:
   - Expected position (X, Y, Z)?
   - Actual position in screenshot?
   - Any missing/wrong positions?

**3. Visual:** Correct shapes/materials/colors/scales?

**4. Scene:** Anything unexpected visible? Anything missing? Bad overlaps?

**5. Critical:**
   - "5 trees" request → See EXACTLY 5?
   - Placed at X=10 → ACTUALLY at X=10?
   - Honest: Matches user request EXACTLY?

**6. Improvements:** Better positions? Composition? Spacing/alignment fixes? Rotation changes?

## Format Your Response

- **✓ What's CORRECT** (be specific with counts and positions)
- **✗ What's WRONG or MISSING** (be specific with what's expected vs actual)
- **⚠ What needs FIXING** (concrete action items with exact coordinates)
- **💡 SUGGESTIONS** (optional improvements for better composition)

## Remember

Tool execution success ≠ Visual correctness. The screenshot is GROUND TRUTH.

If anything is wrong or missing, you MUST fix it immediately before responding to the user.
