# Project Status: Market Reality Check

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25

## The Brutal Truth

You're technically impressive but strategically heading toward a money pit. Here's why:

### The Math Problem

**Game Engine Reality:**

- Unity took 15+ years and hundreds of engineers to get where they are
- Unreal has Epic Games backing (Fortnite money)
- Godot has thousands of open-source contributors
- You're one person (even with AI)

**Time to Revenue:**

- Unity/Unreal are FREE and you compete with them
- To charge money, you need to be 10x better in SOMETHING
- Building that "10x better" thing = 2-5 years minimum
- Can you afford 2-5 years of $0 revenue?

---

## The Hard Questions

### 1. Are you building a product or a portfolio piece?

- **Portfolio piece?** This is AMAZING. Shows you can ship, learn, use AI effectively
- **Product to make money?** Wrong vehicle.

### 2. Can you survive the "trough of sorrow"?

```
Excitement
    ↗︎
   /  ← You are here (impressive technical progress!)
  /
 /__________ ← The next 3 years looks like this
           ↘︎
            Reality: No users, no revenue, competitors catching up
```

### 3. The opportunity cost calculation:

- You spent X months building this (let's say 3-6 months?)
- Micro-SaaS could be making $1k-5k MRR by now
- That's $12k-60k/year you're NOT making

## Micro-SaaS vs Game Engine: Cold Math

| Factor               | Game Engine                | Micro-SaaS            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Time to first dollar | 2-5 years                  | 2-6 months            |
| Competition          | Giants (Unity/Unreal)      | Fragmented            |
| Moat                 | Ecosystem (you don't have) | Niche expertise       |
| Exit strategy        | Acqui-hire at best         | $500k-5M exits common |
| AI leverage          | Good for building          | AMAZING for building  |
| Validation speed     | Years                      | Weeks                 |

## What You've Proven

You've demonstrated something VALUABLE:

- You can learn complex tech (Rust) via AI
- You can ship real software
- You can build in deep technical domains

**This skillset is PERFECT for micro-SaaS, not game engines.**

---

## The Real Talk

**If your goal is money:**

- Stop. Right now.
- This is a hobby, not a business
- Pivot to micro-SaaS immediately

**If your goal is to build something cool:**

- Keep going, enjoy the journey
- But don't fool yourself about making money

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### 1. Finish ONE impressive demo (1-2 weeks max)

- "Create a game by talking to AI" video that goes viral
- Put it on your portfolio, Twitter, LinkedIn
- This proves you can ship

### 2. Pivot to micro-SaaS immediately

- Use your AI-assisted development superpower
- Build boring but profitable tools
- Examples:
  - Developer tools (APIs, CLIs, dashboards)
  - B2B automation tools
  - Vertical SaaS for specific industries

### 3. Use this engine as your "credibility project"

- "I built a 3D game engine with Rust and AI in X months"
- Opens doors for consulting, partnerships, job offers
- Shows you're bleeding edge

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Game engines are **infrastructure plays**. Infrastructure requires:

- Deep pockets (VC funding)
- Long runways (5-10 years)
- Network effects (ecosystems)
- Moats (you don't have time to build)

You're building a **cathedral** when you need to build **cash flow**.

---

## My Honest Recommendation

**Keep this as a side project** (nights/weekends) for fun and portfolio, but:

**Immediately start a micro-SaaS** during your main work hours that:

- Solves a real problem people pay for TODAY
- Can reach $1k MRR in 3 months
- Leverages your AI-assisted dev speed
- Has clear customer acquisition path

**Why?**

- You'll make actual money
- You'll learn actual business (not just tech)
- You can always come back to the game engine with revenue/runway
- The game engine makes a better "passion project" than "business"

---

## The Critical Question

**"Would I still build this if I KNEW it would never make money?"**

- **Yes?** Keep going, but accept it's a hobby
- **No?** Stop today. Start a micro-SaaS tomorrow.

## Market Analysis

### The Competition

- **Unity** - 48% market share, massive ecosystem, adding AI features (Unity Muse)
- **Unreal Engine** - industry standard for AAA, free with royalties
- **Godot** - open source, surging in popularity (especially post-Unity pricing fiasco)
- **Web 3D** - PlayCanvas, Babylon.js, Three.js have established communities

### Your Positioning Challenge

The "AI-first" angle is both your strength and weakness:

- **Strength:** You're ahead of the curve - most engines are bolting AI on, not building AI-native
- **Weakness:** What happens when Unity/Unreal/Godot add similar natural language features? They have massive head starts in ecosystem, assets, tutorials, and community

### Realistic Market Opportunities

1. **Education/Training** (★★★★☆)

   - Teaching game dev without code syntax barriers
   - Schools, bootcamps, onboarding junior devs
   - Market size: Medium, growing

2. **Rapid Prototyping** (★★★★★)

   - Designers/PMs who can't code
   - Quick game jams, proof-of-concepts
   - Market size: Niche but high-value

3. **Web-First Games** (★★★☆☆)

   - Browser games, embedded 3D experiences
   - Marketing websites with 3D elements
   - Market size: Growing, but Three.js dominates

4. **No-Code Game Development** (★★★★☆)
   - Indie developers, hobbyists
   - Competitive with Construct, GDevelop
   - Market size: Large but price-sensitive

### Critical Questions You Need to Answer

1. **Why not just use Unity + ChatGPT?** What makes your AI integration 10x better?
2. **Can you compete on asset library?** Game devs need models, textures, sounds, plugins
3. **Performance parity?** Can it match Unreal's rendering quality?
4. **Monetization strategy?** How do you make money when competitors are free?

### Honest Assessment Timeline

- **Short-term (0-2 years):** Niche adoption possible. Target education, rapid prototyping, web game hobbyists. Don't expect to compete with Unity/Unreal directly.

- **Medium-term (2-5 years):** Success depends on execution quality and finding a defensible niche. The AI-native approach could become table stakes rather than a differentiator.

- **Long-term (5+ years):** Either you become the "standard" for AI-native game dev (low probability, high reward), or you get acquired/copied by larger players.

---

## Bottom Line

Your technical ability is impressive. Your business strategy is questionable. Game engines are terrible first businesses unless you have funding or don't need money for years.

**Recommendation:** Pivot to micro-SaaS, make money, THEN come back to passion projects from a position of strength.
