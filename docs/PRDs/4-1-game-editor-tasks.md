# Game Editor Development Status & Tasks

## Overview

This document tracks the development status of the Unity-like game editor and outlines completed features and remaining tasks. The editor is now fully integrated with the ECS system and provides a comprehensive development environment.

## 1. Current State (Completed Features)

**‚úÖ Core Editor Infrastructure:**

- Unity-like interface with hierarchy, inspector, and viewport panels
- Full ECS integration with BitECS for entity and component management
- Real-time component editing with type-safe forms and validation
- Scene serialization and loading with proper entity restoration

**‚úÖ Entity Management:**

- Create, delete, and manage entities through the ECS system
- Parent-child relationships in the hierarchy with proper transforms
- Entity selection and multi-selection capabilities
- Entity duplication and naming with automatic numbering

**‚úÖ Component System:**

- Transform, MeshRenderer, RigidBody, MeshCollider, and Camera components
- Visual component editing through the inspector panel
- Add/remove components with proper validation and defaults
- Component state synchronization between editor and runtime

---

**‚úÖ 3D Viewport:**

- Interactive 3D scene rendering with React Three Fiber
- Entity selection with visual highlighting and outlines
- Transform gizmos for position, rotation, and scale manipulation
- Camera controls with orbit, pan, and zoom functionality
- Grid and axis helpers for spatial reference

**‚úÖ Asset Management:**

- GLTF/GLB model loading and integration
- Texture and material support
- Drag-and-drop asset handling
- Asset optimization and caching

## 2. Advanced Features (In Progress)

**üöß Physics Integration:**

- Visual physics debugging with collider wireframes
- Physics simulation integration with Rapier
- Real-time physics parameter adjustment
- Collision detection visualization

**üöß Custom Geometry System:**

- Keyframe animation support
- Animation blending and transitions
- Skeletal animation for character models

**‚è≥ Lighting System:**

- Advanced lighting controls
- Shadow configuration
- Environment lighting setup
- Light probes and reflection probes

**‚è≥ Audio Integration:**

- 3D spatial audio system
- Audio source component
- Sound effect and music management
- Audio listener configuration

**‚è≥ Collaboration Features:**

- Real-time collaborative editing
- Version control integration
- Team project management
- Asset sharing and synchronization

**‚è≥ Build System:**

- Multi-platform build pipeline
- Asset bundling and optimization
- Progressive web app deployment
- Desktop app packaging (Electron/Tauri)

## 4. Development Workflow Example

**Current Workflow: Adding a Cube in the Editor**

1. User clicks "Add Cube" from the object menu
2. Editor calls `createCube()` from `useEntityCreation` hook
3. System creates ECS entity with Transform and MeshRenderer components
4. Entity automatically appears in hierarchy panel with proper naming
5. Entity renders in 3D viewport with selectable mesh
6. Inspector shows component properties for real-time editing
7. All changes are immediately reflected in the scene
8. Scene can be saved/loaded with full entity state preservation

**Technical Implementation:**

- ECS-driven state management throughout the editor
- React hooks provide seamless integration between UI and engine
- Component updates trigger automatic re-rendering
- Type-safe interfaces ensure data consistency
