# Modular Architecture Strategy for Vibe Coder 3D

This document outlines a strategy for ensuring a modular architecture in Vibe Coder 3D, facilitating scalability, ease of maintenance, and straightforward addition of new features by both human developers and AI agents.

## Core Principles for Modularity

The project's existing plan to structure code into `src/ai`, `src/core`, `src/editor`, and `src/game` provides a good foundation. The following principles will enhance this:

1.  **Strict Adherence to Entity Component System (ECS):**

    - Enforce the pattern of keeping data within `Components` and logic within `Systems`.
    - This inherently promotes modularity, as new features often translate to new `Components` and `Systems` that can be developed and tested in relative isolation.

2.  **Plugin/Module System for Core Functionalities & Systems:**

    - Design a mechanism (e.g., a central `SystemManager` or `PluginRegistry`) that allows new `Systems` (e.g., for new gameplay mechanics, AI capabilities, or editor tools) to be registered with and orchestrated by the engine dynamically.
    - This allows extending engine capabilities without modifying core engine code directly.

3.  **Service-Oriented Core Engine (`src/core`):**

    - Structure core functionalities (rendering, physics, input processing, AI command execution, asset loading) as distinct services with clear, well-defined APIs.
    - New features, whether in the editor, game-specific logic, or AI systems, can then consume these services without needing to know their internal implementation details.

4.  **Well-Defined `EditorAPI` / `EngineCommands` Boundaries:**

    - As highlighted in `Key_Engine_Abstractions.md`, the API used by the AI to interact with the editor and engine core is paramount. This API acts as a critical modular boundary.
    - A stable and well-documented `EditorAPI` allows the AI development (e.g., NLP, command generation) to proceed independently of the core engine implementation, as long as the contract is respected.

5.  **Modular Editor Design:**

    - The editor itself should be composed of distinct modules (e.g., Viewport, Hierarchy Panel, Inspector Panel, AI Chat Interface, Asset Browser).
    - Each editor module should interact with the core engine services and other editor modules through well-defined interfaces, an event bus, or shared state management (e.g., Zustand, as chosen per `project-overview.md`).

6.  **Standardized Component and System Registration/Discovery:**

    - Implement a straightforward process for developers (and AI via code generation) to:
      - Define new `Component` types.
      - Create new `Systems` that operate on these `Components`.
      - Have these new elements automatically discovered and integrated into the engine's main loop, editor UI (e.g., for inspector panels), and AI's knowledge base.

7.  **Comprehensive Documentation and Schemas for APIs and Data Structures:**

    - Crucially, the `EditorAPI`, component structures, and event types must be meticulously documented.
    - Providing schemas (e.g., JSON Schema, TypeScript definitions) for these can enable automated validation and better understanding by AI agents, facilitating more reliable AI-driven development and feature addition.

8.  **Decoupled Communication via Event System:**
    - Leverage the planned `Event System` to enable communication between modules without creating direct dependencies, further enhancing modularity.

By emphasizing these principles, Vibe Coder 3D can achieve an architecture that is not only scalable and maintainable but also highly conducive to feature expansion by a diverse team of human developers and collaborating AI systems.
