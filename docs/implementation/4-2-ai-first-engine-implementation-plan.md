## Overview

### Context & Goals

- **AI-First Paradigm Shift**: Transform Vibe Coder 3D from a traditional React Three Fiber game engine into an AI-first development platform where developers can describe their intent in natural language and see it realized through intelligent assistance.
- **Preserve Developer Autonomy**: Maintain full manual control and override capabilities while providing intelligent automation and suggestions.
- **Accelerate Development Workflow**: Enable rapid prototyping through conversational interfaces that understand game development patterns and best practices.
- **Bridge Technical Gaps**: Make 3D game development accessible to creators who may not have deep technical expertise in Three.js, physics, or ECS systems.

### Current Pain Points

- **Complex Setup Overhead**: Traditional game engines require extensive technical knowledge to get started with even simple concepts.
- **Manual Asset Integration**: Finding, importing, and configuring 3D models, textures, and audio requires significant time and expertise.
- **Boilerplate Scripting**: Writing repetitive controller scripts, interaction logic, and UI components slows development.
- **Debugging Complexity**: Identifying issues with physics, collisions, performance, or ECS synchronization requires deep system knowledge.

## Proposed Solution

### High-level Summary

- **Conversational Development Interface**: Implement a sophisticated AI Copilot that understands natural language commands and translates them into precise engine operations.
- **Intelligent Asset Management**: AI-powered asset discovery, generation, and optimization that can source or create content based on descriptions.
- **Contextual Code Generation**: Automated script generation for controllers, game logic, UI components, and system integrations.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: AI actively participates in the development process, suggesting improvements, catching issues, and learning from user preferences.
- **Seamless Build Pipeline**: AI-assisted packaging and optimization for multiple deployment targets.

## Technical Details

### Core AI Service Interface

```typescript
// src/ai/core/AIService.ts
export interface AIService {
  processCommand(input: string, context: ProjectContext): Promise<AIResponse>;
  suggestAction(context: SceneContext): Promise<AISuggestion[]>;
  generateCode(request: CodeRequest): Promise<GeneratedCode>;
  analyzeScene(sceneId: string): Promise<SceneAnalysis>;
  optimizePerformance(metrics: PerformanceMetrics): Promise<OptimizationPlan>;
}

// src/ai/types/Commands.ts
export interface AICommand {
  type: CommandType;
  payload: any;
  validation: ValidationRules;
  execute(context: EngineContext): Promise<CommandResult>;
}

// src/core/ai-integration/EngineAPI.ts
export interface EngineAPI {
  scene: SceneOperations;
  assets: AssetOperations;
  scripts: ScriptOperations;
  physics: PhysicsOperations;
  state: StateOperations;
}
```

### Command Processing Pipeline

```typescript
// src/ai/core/CommandParser.ts
export class CommandParser {
  async parseNaturalLanguage(input: string): Promise<ParsedCommand>;
  async validateCommand(command: ParsedCommand): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  async executeCommand(command: ValidatedCommand): Promise<ExecutionResult>;
}

// src/ai/commands/SceneCommands.ts
export class SceneCommands {
  createObject(description: string, position?: Vector3): Promise<EntityId>;
  modifyObject(entityId: EntityId, modifications: ObjectModifications): Promise<void>;
  deleteObject(entityId: EntityId): Promise<void>;
  groupObjects(entityIds: EntityId[], groupName?: string): Promise<GroupId>;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Scene Creation

```typescript
// User: "Create a red sphere at the center of the scene"
const aiResponse = await aiService.processCommand(
  'Create a red sphere at the center of the scene',
  currentProjectContext,
);

// AI generates and executes:
const entity = await sceneCommands.createObject('sphere', Vector3.ZERO);
await sceneCommands.modifyObject(entity, {
  material: { color: 'red' },
  transform: { position: [0, 0, 0] },
});
```

### Asset Generation Integration

```typescript
// User: "Add a medieval castle to my scene"
const suggestions = await aiService.suggestAction({
  scene: currentScene,
  query: 'medieval castle',
});

// AI can:
// 1. Search existing asset libraries
// 2. Generate procedural castle
// 3. Suggest composition of existing assets
// 4. Guide user through manual creation
```

### Script Generation

```typescript
// User: "Make the player jump when spacebar is pressed"
const code = await aiService.generateCode({
  type: 'player-controller',
  behavior: 'jump on spacebar',
  target: selectedEntity,
});

// Generates:
// - Input handling hook
// - Physics impulse application
// - Animation triggers
// - Sound effect integration
```
