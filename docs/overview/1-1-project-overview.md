# Project Overview: Vibe Coder 3D - Unity-like Game Editor/Engine

## Vision

Vibe Coder 3D is a **Unity-like game editor and engine** built with modern web technologies, designed to provide a powerful, browser-based game development environment. It combines the familiar workflow of Unity's editor with the performance and flexibility of React Three Fiber, offering both visual editing tools and a robust runtime engine for 3D game development.

Our mission is to create a professional-grade game development platform that leverages web technologies to enable rapid prototyping, collaborative development, and seamless deployment across platforms, with planned AI-assisted features to enhance the development experience.

## Goals

- **Unity-like Editor Experience:** Provide a familiar game development interface with hierarchy panels, inspector views, and visual scene editing tools.
- **Professional 3D Development:** Enable creation of high-quality 3D games and experiences using modern web technologies and performant rendering.
- **Component-based Architecture:** Implement a robust Entity Component System (ECS) for scalable, maintainable game development.
- **Visual Development Tools:** Offer intuitive scene editing, asset management, and property manipulation through a comprehensive editor interface.
- **Modern Web Stack:** Build on proven technologies like React Three Fiber, BitECS, Rapier physics, and TypeScript for reliable development.
- **Cross-platform Deployment:** Support game deployment across web, desktop, and mobile platforms through modern build tools.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Design a plugin-friendly system that allows for custom components, tools, and workflow extensions.
- **Planned AI Integration:** Future AI-assisted development features to accelerate common development tasks while preserving full developer control.

## Target Audience

## Core Technology

Our Unity-like editor is built on modern web technologies and proven game development libraries:

**Game Engine Foundation:**

- **Rendering:** React Three Fiber (R3F) built on Three.js for high-performance 3D graphics and WebGL rendering
- **Physics:** Rapier.js via WebAssembly for realistic physics simulation and collision detection
- **Entity Component System:** BitECS for scalable, data-oriented game architecture with excellent performance
- **State Management:** Zustand for reactive, predictable application state management
- **Asset Pipeline:** Optimized loading and processing of GLTF/GLB models, textures, and audio assets

**Editor Interface:**

- **UI Framework:** React with TypeScript for type-safe, component-based editor interface development
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent UI development with utility-first approach
- **3D Controls:** React Three Drei for interactive 3D controls, gizmos, and camera management
- **Forms & Validation:** Type-safe component property editing with real-time validation

**Development Infrastructure:**

- **Build System:** Vite for lightning-fast development server and optimized production builds
- **Package Management:** Yarn for reliable dependency management and workspace support
- **Testing:** Vitest for unit testing with React Testing Library for component testing
- **Code Quality:** ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting and quality enforcement

**Planned Integrations:**

- **AI Assistance:** Future integration with language models for development assistance
- **Collaboration:** Planned Yjs integration for real-time collaborative editing
- **Deployment:** Multi-platform build targets for web, desktop (Electron/Tauri), and mobile

For detailed technical specifications, see the [Technical Stack](../architecture/2-2-technical-stack.md) and [Project Structure](../architecture/2-3-project-structure.md) documentation.

## Architecture

The editor follows a Unity-like architecture with clear separation between the core engine and development tools:

**Core Layers:**

- **`src/core`:** Game engine foundation with ECS, physics, rendering, and asset management systems
- **`src/editor`:** Unity-like development environment with hierarchy, inspector, and viewport panels
- **`src/config`:** Application configuration and asset metadata management
- **`src/utils`:** Shared utilities for math operations, validation, and helper functions

**Editor Interface:**

- **Hierarchy Panel:** Scene tree view for organizing and managing game objects with parent-child relationships
- **Inspector Panel:** Component property editor with type-safe forms and real-time validation
- **Viewport Panel:** Interactive 3D scene view with gizmos, selection tools, and camera controls
- **Asset Management:** Drag-and-drop asset loading with automatic optimization and integration

**Development Workflow:**

- **Scene System:** Visual scene composition with save/load functionality and version control support
- **Component System:** Extensible ECS architecture with visual component editing and custom component creation
- **Build Pipeline:** Optimized builds for multiple deployment targets with asset bundling and optimization

This architecture provides a familiar Unity-like development experience while leveraging modern web technologies. See the [Project Structure](../architecture/2-3-project-structure.md) for detailed organization and [Game Editor Architecture](../architecture/2-6-game-editor.md) for editor-specific design.
