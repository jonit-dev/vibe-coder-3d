# Project Roadmap: Vibe Coder 3D - AI-First Game Engine

This document outlines the development roadmap for transforming Vibe Coder 3D into the first truly conversational game engine. Our goal is to enable natural language-driven game development while maintaining the power and flexibility of traditional engines.

> **Status Update (December 2024):** Foundation phase complete. Beginning AI Copilot integration with enhanced timeline and objectives.

**Current Focus: Initiating AI Copilot Core Functionality**

Following the completion of Phase 1, our immediate focus is on implementing the core capabilities for the AI Copilot. This involves starting key tasks from Phase 2, specifically:

- üí° **AI Command Parser:** Developing the system to translate natural language into engine commands.
- üí° **AI Scene Manipulation:** Enabling the AI to create, modify, and manage scene objects.

These tasks are crucial for bringing the conversational game development experience to life.

## Guiding Principles

- **AI-First, User-Centric:** AI features should enhance, not replace, developer creativity and control.
- **Iterative AI Development:** Build and refine AI capabilities incrementally, based on user feedback and technical feasibility.
- **Core First:** Prioritize the development and stabilization of the `src/core` framework with robust AI integration points.
- **Test Early, Test Often:** Integrate basic testing (unit, integration) from the beginning, including tests for AI interactions.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation for both engine features and AI Copilot usage.
