# Project Roadmap: Vibe Coder 3D - AI-First Game Engine

This document outlines the development roadmap for transforming Vibe Coder 3D into the first truly conversational game engine. Our goal is to enable natural language-driven game development while maintaining the power and flexibility of traditional engines.

> **Status Update (December 2024):** Foundation phase complete. Beginning AI Copilot integration with enhanced timeline and objectives.

**Current Focus: Entity Hierarchy & Core Rendering**

Following the completion of Phase 1 and Phase 2, our immediate focus is on completing the foundational systems for scene management and rendering. This involves:

- **Parent-Child Entity Relationships:** Implementing hierarchical entity relationships with transform inheritance
- **Enhanced Lighting System:** Completing the rendering pipeline with comprehensive lighting support
- **Input & Basic Interaction:** Establishing core user interaction patterns

These foundational systems will provide a solid base for content creation and advanced features.

## Guiding Principles

- **AI-First, User-Centric:** AI features should enhance, not replace, developer creativity and control.
- **Iterative AI Development:** Build and refine AI capabilities incrementally, based on user feedback and technical feasibility.
- **Core First:** Prioritize the development and stabilization of the `src/core` framework with robust AI integration points.
- **Test Early, Test Often:** Integrate basic testing (unit, integration) from the beginning, including tests for AI interactions.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation for both engine features and AI Copilot usage.
