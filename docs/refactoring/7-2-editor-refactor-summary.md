# Editor.tsx Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The Editor.tsx component has been refactored to follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), KISS, and DRY principles while preventing unnecessary re-renders.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Encapsulated State Management (`useEditorState.ts`)

**Problem**: Multiple individual Zustand store selectors caused unnecessary re-renders
**Solution**: Grouped related state selectors into focused hooks:

- `useEntityState()` - Entity management state
- `useUIState()` - UI panel and menu state
- `usePhysicsState()` - Physics simulation state
- `useAppState()` - Status and performance metrics

**Benefits**:

- Reduced re-renders by grouping related state
- Cleaner component code
- Better separation of concerns

### 2. Entity Synchronization Hook (`useEntitySynchronization.ts`)

**Problem**: Complex ECS synchronization logic cluttered the main component
**Solution**: Extracted entity synchronization logic into dedicated hook
**Benefits**:

- Single responsibility for ECS system integration
- Reusable logic
- Simplified main component

### 3. Action Handlers Hook (`useEditorHandlers.ts`)

**Problem**: Many handler functions scattered throughout component
**Solution**: Consolidated all action handlers into one hook:

- Entity creation handlers
- Scene action handlers (save/load/clear)
- Physics control handlers
- UI toggle handlers

**Benefits**:

- DRY principle - handlers grouped together
- Consistent error handling
- Easier to test and maintain

### 4. Auto-Selection Hook (`useAutoSelection.ts`)

**Problem**: Auto-selection logic mixed with other concerns
**Solution**: Dedicated hook for entity auto-selection logic
**Benefits**:

- Single responsibility
- Easy to test independently
- Cleaner component logic

### 5. Performance Stats Hook (`useEditorStats.ts`)

**Problem**: Stats calculation inline in component
**Solution**: Memoized stats calculation in dedicated hook
**Benefits**:

- Prevents StatusBar re-renders
- Reusable stats logic
- Performance optimization

## Performance Improvements

1. **Fewer Re-renders**: Grouped state selectors reduce the number of component re-renders
2. **Memoized Calculations**: Stats are properly memoized
3. **Cleaner Dependencies**: Each hook has focused dependencies
4. **Better Event Handling**: Handlers are properly memoized and grouped

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **SRP**: Each hook has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **DRY**: Common patterns consolidated (handlers, state management)
3. **KISS**: Simplified main component, complex logic extracted
4. **Testability**: Each hook can be tested independently
5. **Maintainability**: Concerns are properly separated

## File Structure

```
src/editor/hooks/
├── useEditorState.ts      # Grouped Zustand state management
├── useEntitySynchronization.ts  # ECS system integration
├── useEditorHandlers.ts   # Action handlers consolidation
├── useAutoSelection.ts    # Entity auto-selection logic
└── useEditorStats.ts      # Performance stats calculation
```

## Before vs After

### Before (322 lines)

- Multiple individual store selectors
- Complex inline logic
- Mixed concerns
- Handler functions scattered throughout

### After (181 lines)

- Grouped state management
- Extracted hooks for different concerns
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- 44% reduction in component size

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to component API
- Performance improvements are transparent
- New hooks can be reused in other components if needed
