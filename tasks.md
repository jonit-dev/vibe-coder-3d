# Bugs

[x] When we manually move the entity on the editor viewport, properties changed do not reflect on inspector panel transform

# Scalability

[ ] We need to refactor the ECS system to be more scalable (easier to add more functionality) and also sync nicely with the editor viewport and inspector panel
